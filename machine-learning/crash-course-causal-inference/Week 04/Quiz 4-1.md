1. Someone who was likely to be treated, given their covariates, but wasn't:

- will have a small weight
- >will have a large weight

2. Marginal structural models are models of:

- >the mean of the potential outcome of a function of possible values of treatment
- the mean of the observed outcome given observed treatment

3. IPTW estimation works because

- it does not assume the data are normally distributed
- >it creates an unconfounded pseudo-population
- it involves removing outliers
