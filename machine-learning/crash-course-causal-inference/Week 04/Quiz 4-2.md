1. Inverse probability of treatment weighting involves weighting the data by:

- 1 divided by the propensity score for controls and 1 divided by 1 minus the propensity score for treated subjects
- 1 divided by the propensity score for all subjects
- >1 divided by the propensity score for treated subjects and 1 divided by 1 minus the propensity score for control subjects


2. Among control subjects, would someone with a high value of the propensity score get more or less weight than someone with a low value of the propensity score?

- Less weight
- >More weight

3. Marginal structural models are used to model:

- causal effects of treatment on the treated
- >average causal effects

4. The pseudo-population refers to the population:

- before weighting
- >after weighting


5. Compared with situations where weights are small, large weights lead to causal effect estimates that are:

- less variable
- >more variable


6. Near violation of the positivity assumption occurs when there are some weights that are very large.

- >True
- False

7. Weight truncation is the same as trimming the tails.

- >False
- True


8. Weight truncation, compared with no weight truncation, will likely lead to causal effect estimates:

- that have less bias and less variance 
- that have more bias and more variance 
- >that have more bias, but less variance 
- that have less bias, but more variance


9. Doubly robust estimators require that:

- both the propensity score and outcome models are correctly specified
- >either the propensity score model or outcome model are correctly specified
