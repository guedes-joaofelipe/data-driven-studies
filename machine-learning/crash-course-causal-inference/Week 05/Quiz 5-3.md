1. The intention-to-treat effect is:

- > the causal effect of treatment assignment on the outcome
- not a causal effect
- the cause effect of treatment received on the outcome

2. The potential treatment values of a complier is:

- A0=1, A1=1
- A0=0, A1=0
- >A0=0, A1=1
- A0=1, A1=0


3. Treatment assignment has no impact on treatment received for:

- >always takers and never takers
- compliers and defiers

4. In instrumental variables analysis, what is meant by a local treatment effect?

- Intention-to-treat effect
- Treatment effect for the whole population
- >Treatment effect among compliers only
- Casual effect of treatment assignment on treatment received


5. The monotonicity assumption is necessary for estimation of:

- effect of treatment assignment on treatment received
- effect of treatment assignment on the outcome
- >complier average causal effect


6. If we do not make the monotonicity assumption, somebody who was observed to have Z=1 and A=0 is:

- definitely a defier
- neither a never taker nor a defier
- >either a never taker or defier
- definitely a never taker

7. If we do make the monotonicity assumption, somebody who was observed to have Z=1 and A=0 is:

- >definitely a never taker
- definitely a defier
- either a never taker or defier
- neither a never taker nor a defier

8. The assumption that the instrumental variable, Z, only affects the outcome through its effect on treatment is called:

- consistency
- positivity
- monotonicity
- >the exclusion restriction


9. The first stage or two stage least squares is:

- >regression of treatment received on the instrumental variable
- x regression of the outcome on treatment received
- regression of the outcome on the instrumental variable

10. The strength of an instrumental variable can be measured by:

- >the association between the instrumental variable and treatment
- the association between the outcome and the instrumental variable

11. A weak instrument will tend to lead to estimates of causal effects that have:

- small standard errors
- >large standard errors

12. Instrumental variable methods do not require:

- >the ignorability assumption
- the consistency assumption
- the positivity assumption
