1. An instrumental variable is a variable that:

- directly affects both the treatment and the outcome
- affects the outcome but does not affect treatment
- >affects treatment and only affects the outcome through its effect on treatment


2. The potential treatment values of an always taker is:

- A0=1, A1=0
- >A0=1, A1=1
- A0=0, A1=1
- A0=0, A1=0


3. The monotonicity assumption implies that there are no:

- compliers
- never takers
- >defiers
- always takers
