1. The second stage of two stage least squares is:

- regression of the instrumental variable on the outcome
- regression of the outcome on observed treatment
- >regression of the outcome on the predicted value of treatment (from the stage 1 model)

2. A strong instrument is one that:

- is highly predictive of treatment
- is independent of treatment
- >is highly correlated with the outcome
