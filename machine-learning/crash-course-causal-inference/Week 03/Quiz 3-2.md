1. For optimal matching, what is optimized?
- >Total distance is minimized
- Distance is minimized one matched pair at a time
- Total distance is maximized


2. After matching, balance can be assessed by:

- whether the causal effect estimate is significant
- >standardized differences


3. A large standardized difference for a covariate suggests:

- nothing, as standardized differences should not be used
- there is balance on this covariate
- >there is imbalance on this covariate


4. If there is a large treatment effect, then we expect the observed difference in mean of the outcome between matched pairs to be:

- similar to the difference in means if we randomly permute the treatment labels
- >very different from the difference in means if we randomly permute the treatment labels
