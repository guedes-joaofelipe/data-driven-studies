1. Matching and calculation of standardized differences on the matched data can take place without using the outcome
variable.

- >True
- False


2. Optimal matching is less computationally demanding than greedy matching.

- True
- >False


3. A smaller value of the caliper would tend to lead to:

- >Smaller standardized differences
- Larger standardized differences


4. Many-to-one matching, as opposed to pair matching, would tend to lead to estimates of causal effects that have:

- >more bias but less variability
- less bias but more variability


5. A method for assessing the impact of violations of causal assumptions is:

- Bootstrapping
- >Sensitivity analysis
- Calibration


6. Standardized differences are very sensitive to sample size:

- True
- >False
