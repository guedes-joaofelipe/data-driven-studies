1. Consider the following code:

```python
a = torch.tensor([10,9,8,7])
```

What is the output of :

```python
a[1:3] ?
```

- >tensor([9,8])
- tensor([9,8,7])
- [9,8,7]


2. Consider the following code:

```python
u=torch.tensor([1,2])
v=torch.tensor([0,1])
````

What is the output of:

```python
 torch.dot(u, v)
```
